more complex TicTacToe
One of my first JS projects.

##Rules

Rules are same as in classic TicTacToe. The game goes on "GAME" board. Players choose, where to put their marks. When one of the players clicks the red sqare, his mark will stay on board at the bagginig of next round. The goal is to have three marks next to each other. When one wins, "GAME" board is beeing replaced with "NEXT BOARD". Player, that wins two times, win the whole game.
